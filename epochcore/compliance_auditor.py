"""
GOVERNANCE: Strict adherence to master governance documents required
REFERENCE: GOVERNANCE.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md
COMPOUND STEPS: Ethics (1/8), Policy (2/8), Positivity (3/8)
FRAMEWORK: Recursive autonomous improvement with escalation protocols

This module operates under strict governance ensuring:
- Ethics: All operations maintain ethical standards with immediate escalation
- Policy: Zero tolerance policy compliance with automated validation
- Positivity: Positive impact enforcement with measurable outcomes
- Automation: Scalable automation-first approach with compounding benefits
- Improvement: Continuous recursive improvement through feedback loops
- Escalation: Multi-tier escalation for exceptions and governance violations


ORIGINAL: Compliance Auditor for recursive governance and security auditing.
