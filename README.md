# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

## Copilot Coding Agent Onboarding

This repository is now onboarded for Copilot coding agent automation.

### Impact Propagation Engine
- See `impact_propagation_engine.py` for the core engine implementation.
- Follow [Copilot coding agent best practices](https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips) for automation and recursive improvements.

### Agent Management System
- See `add_agent.ps1` for PowerShell-based agent creation and management
- See `AGENT_MANAGEMENT.md` for detailed documentation and usage examples
- Includes strict governance, audit trails, and integration presets

### Getting Started
1. Review the engine class and extend as needed for your dependency analysis.
2. Use Copilot coding agent to automate improvements and propagate fixes.
3. Create and manage agents using the PowerShell script with full governance support.
