# Private Repository Configuration Summary

## What's Been Done

The repository has been configured for private access with enhanced security features:

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - Created directory structure for agent management system
   - Added README files to explain each directory's purpose
   - Set up proper .gitkeep files to track empty directories

2. **Security Configuration**:
   - Created `make_repository_private.sh` to set repository privacy settings
   - Added `.github/CODEOWNERS` to define code ownership and review requirements
   - Created GitHub Actions workflow for security scanning (`security-scan.yml`)
   - Added Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
   - Created security scanning script (`scan_security.sh`) for local validation
   - Set up issue and pull request templates with security considerations
   - Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive data exposure

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added security section to the main README.md
   - Created detailed security policy in `docs/SECURITY.md`
   - Added access control definitions in `docs/ACCESS_CONTROL.md`
   - Created contribution guidelines in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Set up initialization script (`init_private_repo.sh`)
   - Created directory structure for agent management
   - Prepared scripts for repository configuration

## How to Use

To complete the private repository configuration:

1. **Initialize Repository Structure**:

   ```bash
   ./init_private_repo.sh
   ```

2. **Review and Configure Privacy Settings**:

   ```bash
   # Review and modify the script if needed
   ./make_repository_private.sh
   ```

3. **Run Security Scan**:

   ```bash
   ./scan_security.sh
   ```

4. **Set Up Team Permissions in GitHub**:
   - Create the required teams in your GitHub organization
   - Assign appropriate permissions according to the access control policy

## Next Steps

1. Add team members to the repository with appropriate permissions
2. Configure branch protection rules in GitHub
3. Enable security alerts and automated security fixes
4. Set up required status checks for the security-scan workflow
5. Add agent manifests to begin using the agent management system

## Security Best Practices

- All contributors should enable two-factor authentication
- All commits should be signed with GPG keys
- Regular security scans should be performed
- Access permissions should be reviewed periodically
- Dependencies should be kept up to date with Dependabot
