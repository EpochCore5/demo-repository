# Agent Management System Documentation

## Overview

The Agent Management System provides comprehensive tools for creating, synchronizing, and analyzing agents in your environment with robust governance and audit features.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Creation (`add_agent.ps1`)

The PowerShell agent creation script handles:

- Agent manifest generation with unique identifiers
- Glyph generation for visual identification
- Governance scaffolding and audit trails
- CODEOWNERS and CI/CD workflow setup

### 2. Flash Sync (`flash_sync_agents.sh`)

The synchronization script provides:

- Quick verification of all agents in the roster
- Ledger updates with timestamped entries
- Optional reporting for sync status

### 3. Mesh Graph Generation (`create_mesh_graph.sh`)

The mesh relationship tool offers:

- Relationship mapping between agents based on meshy triggers
- Multiple output formats (JSON, DOT)
- Visualization capabilities (with GraphViz)

## Directory Structure

```bash
├── agents/
│   ├── manifests/        # Agent manifests (JSON)
│   └── roster.json       # Master agent roster
├── assets/
│   └── glyphs/          # Agent glyphs and visual identifiers
├── reports/              # Agent reports and logs
├── ledger/               # Transaction ledger with cryptographic seals
├── bundles/              # Agent bundles (ZIP archives)
└── graphs/               # Relationship graphs and visualizations
```

## Governance Features

- **Idempotency**: Safe to run operations multiple times
- **Atomic Writes**: Prevents corruption during updates
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history via ledger entries
- **Cryptographic Seals**: Content verification with SHA-256
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated verification workflows

## Best Practices

1. Always use the provided tools rather than manual edits
2. Maintain the ledger integrity by using proper sync operations
3. Regularly generate mesh graphs to visualize agent relationships
4. Use the `--report` flag to maintain comprehensive audit records
5. Follow the covenant: "Timestamp → Log → Seal → Archive → Reinject"
