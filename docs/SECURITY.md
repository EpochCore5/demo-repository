# Security & Privacy Configuration

This document outlines the security and privacy measures implemented for this private repository containing the Agent Management System and EpochCore integration.

## Repository Privacy Settings

To ensure this repository remains private:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Set repository visibility to "Private" in GitHub repository settings
   - Use strict team-based access control with specific role assignments
   - Implement required approval workflows for all security-sensitive changes

2. **Authentication Requirements**:
   - Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) requirement for all repository collaborators
   - Consider using SAML SSO for enterprise environments
   - Use personal access tokens with limited scopes for automation

3. **Branch Protection**:
   - Enable branch protection rules for `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Do not allow force pushes or deletions

## Sensitive Data Protection

The Agent Management System handles potentially sensitive data:

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to the repository
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipelines
   - Use environment variables for local development

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Agent manifests should not contain sensitive information
   - Use cryptographic seals for data integrity verification
   - Consider encrypting sensitive parts of the agent manifests

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - All actions are logged with cryptographic seals in the ledger
   - Implement immutable audit logs with tamper evidence
   - Regular backups of audit trails

## Security Features

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Implement scanning for secrets and sensitive data
   - Enforce code style and security checks
   - Validate governance compliance

2. **Continuous Security**:
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Code scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Container scanning if applicable

## Compliance

1. **Governance**:
   - All operations follow strict governance protocols
   - Automated compliance verification
   - Regular compliance auditing

2. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain current security documentation
   - Document all security-related configurations
   - Regular security reviews
