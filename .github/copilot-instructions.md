# GitHub Demo Repository
Static HTML website demonstration repository with GitHub Actions workflows and Primer CSS styling.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively
- Bootstrap and prepare the repository:
  - `npm install` -- takes 2-3 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 30+ seconds.
  - Alternative: `yarn install` -- takes 2-3 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 30+ seconds.
- Serve the static website:
  - `python3 -m http.server 8080` -- starts immediately
  - Visit http://localhost:8080/ to view the website
  - Website displays: "Welcome to the website generated by my demo repository"
- Validate HTML:
  - Install htmlhint: `npm install -g htmlhint` -- takes 3 seconds
  - Run validation: `htmlhint *.html` -- takes <1 second
  - NOTE: Current HTML file missing doctype declaration (known issue)

## Validation
- ALWAYS manually validate any changes by:
  1. Running `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure dependencies work
  2. Starting the HTTP server with `python3 -m http.server 8080`
  3. Accessing http://localhost:8080/ and verifying the page loads correctly
  4. Checking that the heading "Welcome to the website generated by my demo repository" displays
- Run `htmlhint *.html` to validate HTML syntax before committing changes
- The GitHub Actions will automatically run proof-html validation on push

## Common Tasks
The following are outputs from frequently run commands. Reference them instead of viewing, searching, or running bash commands to save time.

### Package.json Contents
```json
{
  "name": "demo-repo",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "description": "A sample package.json",
  "dependencies": {
    "@primer/css": "17.0.1"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### index.html Contents
```html
<h1>Welcome to the website generated by my demo repository</h1>
```

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/auto-assign.yml` - Auto-assigns issues and PRs to Jvryan92
- `.github/workflows/proof-html.yml` - Validates HTML files using anishathalye/proof-html@v1.1.0

## Dependencies
- **@primer/css v17.0.1**: GitHub's design system CSS framework
- Located at: `node_modules/@primer/css/dist/primer.css` after installation
- No build process required - CSS files are pre-compiled

## Known Issues and Limitations
- HTML file is missing `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration (htmlhint validation fails)
- No npm scripts defined in package.json
- No formal test suite - validation is manual only
- Repository is designed for demonstration purposes, not production use

## Build Times and Timeouts
- `npm install`: 2-3 seconds (use 30+ second timeout)
- `yarn install`: 2-3 seconds (use 30+ second timeout)  
- `htmlhint validation`: <1 second (use 10+ second timeout)
- `python3 -m http.server`: starts immediately (use 10+ second timeout)
- GitHub Actions proof-html: ~30 seconds in CI

## File Locations
- Main HTML file: `./index.html`
- Package configuration: `./package.json`
- Documentation: `./README.md`
- Workflows: `./.github/workflows/`
- Dependencies: `./node_modules/` (not committed, install with npm/yarn)
- Primer CSS main file: `./node_modules/@primer/css/dist/primer.css`

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes to `index.html` or other files
2. Run `npm install` if package.json was modified
3. Test with `python3 -m http.server 8080`
4. Validate with `htmlhint *.html`
5. Commit and push - GitHub Actions will run automatically
