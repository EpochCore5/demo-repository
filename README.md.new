# EpochCore5 Demo Repository

This repository demonstrates advanced Copilot coding agent automation with agent management tools.

## 100x Compounded Innovation Simulation

This repository includes a powerful simulation of compounding innovation, where each 0.25 step compounds to achieve 10x higher impact, resulting in exponential growth across 100 steps.

The simulation demonstrates how innovations across multiple dimensions (Recursive Self-Improvement, Autonomous Decision Making, Multi-Agent Orchestration, etc.) create accelerating returns and eventually lead to technological transformation.

### Key Features

- **Exponential Growth Modeling**: Visualizes how small 0.25 step innovations compound to massive impact
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Tracks progress across 8 critical innovation dimensions
- **Breakthrough Detection**: Identifies key points where capabilities fundamentally transform
- **Synergy Effects**: Models how innovations in different dimensions amplify each other

### Running the Simulation

```bash
# Run the interactive demo
python scripts/demo_100x_compounded_innovation.py

# Run the full simulation with visualizations
python scripts/innovation_compound_simulator.py --dimensions 8 --steps 100 --factor 10 --verbose
```

The simulation generates comprehensive reports and visualizations in the `reports/innovation_simulation` directory.

## Copilot Coding Agent Onboarding

This repository is onboarded for Copilot coding agent automation with enhanced agent management.

### Impact Propagation Engine

- See `impact_propagation_engine.py` for the core engine implementation.
- Follow [Copilot coding agent best practices](https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips) for automation and recursive improvements.

### Agent Management Tools

- **Agent Creation**: Use `add_agent.ps1` to add new agents with proper governance and audit trails.
- **Flash Sync**: Run `flash_sync_agents.sh` to synchronize all agents and update their verification status.
- **Mesh Graph**: Run `create_mesh_graph.sh` to generate relationship graphs between agents.
- **Import Agents**: Use `import_agents.sh` to import agents from another repository.
- **Generate Samples**: Run `generate_sample_agents.sh` to create sample agents for testing.
- **EpochCore System**: Run `run_epochcore.sh` to execute the recursive agent system with governance compliance.

### Usage

#### Creating a New Agent

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\add_agent.ps1 -AgentId agent42 -AgentName "Revenue Amplifier" -Role "Sales Funnel Commander"
```

#### Synchronizing All Agents

```bash
./flash_sync_agents.sh [--force] [--verify] [--report]
```

#### Generating Agent Mesh Graphs

```bash
./create_mesh_graph.sh [--output json|dot] [--visualize]
```

#### Importing Agents from Another Repository

```bash
./import_agents.sh --source /path/to/source/repo [--filter pattern] [--dry-run]
```

#### Generating Sample Agents

```bash
./generate_sample_agents.sh [--count N] [--prefix string]
```

#### Running the EpochCore Agent System

```bash
./run_epochcore.sh [--agent registry|compliance|summary] [--sync]
```
