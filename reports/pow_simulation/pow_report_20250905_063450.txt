Security Analysis:
  - Computation Requirements:
    * Difficulty 1: 8.00 hashes (0.0000 seconds on this machine)
    * Difficulty 2: 639.67 hashes (0.0007 seconds on this machine)
    * Difficulty 3: 5537.00 hashes (0.0068 seconds on this machine)
    * Difficulty 4: 74170.00 hashes (0.0842 seconds on this machine)
    * Difficulty 5: 427761.00 hashes (0.4904 seconds on this machine)

  - Scaling Properties:
    * Increasing difficulty from 1 to 2 increased attempts by factor of 79.96 (expected: 16)
    * Increasing difficulty from 2 to 3 increased attempts by factor of 8.66 (expected: 16)
    * Increasing difficulty from 3 to 4 increased attempts by factor of 13.40 (expected: 16)
    * Increasing difficulty from 4 to 5 increased attempts by factor of 5.77 (expected: 16)

  - Implications:
    * Each additional zero in the difficulty increases work by ~16x
    * Difficulty can be precisely adjusted to control block timing
    * Security scales with computational power of the network
    * 51% attack requires majority of computational power

Consensus Implications:
  - Decentralization: No central authority needed for consensus
  - Sybil Resistance: Creating false identities doesn't help without computational power
  - Economic Security: Attack cost scales with network computational power
  - Immutability: Changing past records requires redoing all proof of work

Computational Scaling:
  - At difficulty 5, average of 427761.00 hashes required
  - Each +1 difficulty increases by factor of ~16
  - Estimated hashes for difficulty 8: 1.10e+08
  - Estimated hashes for difficulty 10: 2.80e+10
  - Estimated hashes for difficulty 12: 7.18e+12
